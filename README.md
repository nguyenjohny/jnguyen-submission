Please review this submission where i have also attempted the extension. It is a running solution with spring & in-memory h2db.

I have put a lot of effort into this task, thanks.

### Run

``
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--inputFile=commands.txt"
``

Note: I have also set it to default to `./commands.txt` if not `inputFile` is not specified. This can cause confusion.
